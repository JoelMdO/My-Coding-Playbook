# Playbook

A new Flutter project.

## Purpose

This is an open-source project designed to create a desktop Playbook.
The Playbook is intended to store all your relevant code snippets, notes, or other information.
This way, you can easily access and reuse this information, eliminating the need to constantly search through previous repositories or the internet.
